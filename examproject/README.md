# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Disposable Income Differences in Denmark**. In this dataproject we investigate the development of disposable income in Denmark from 1987 to 2017 using data from Statistics Denmark. In the first part of the project, we examine the development in income differences across regions. In the second part of the project, we examine the development of income inequality between men and women.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** 
* The pydst package is needed to run program. 
* Pydst can be installed by typing "pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst" in the Anaconda Prompt. 
Apart from the pydst package, only the standard Anaconda Python 3 installation is required.
