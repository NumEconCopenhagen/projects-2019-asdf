# Dataproject

In this dataproject we investigate the development of disposable income in Denmark from 1987 to 2017 using data from Statistics Denmark. 

Firstly, we consider the average disposible income differences by Danish regions. Secondly, we investigate the difference in disposible income between men and women. 

In the first part we implement the package ipywidgets to create an interactive bar chart that illustrates the development. We extend the analysis by introdicing a second interactive bar chart where we fix the y-axis to "Denmark" to illustrate the difference in disposible income by region compared to the average of Denmark over time. 

In the second part of the project we create an index for men and women where 1987 = 100. This allows us to analyse the growth in disposible income which we illustrate by creating a figure.
