# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solving Stochastic Differential Equations using Monte Carlo Simulation**. In this project we show how the Monte Carlo methods can be applied to solve stochastic differential equations. First we implement the simple Euler discretization scheme.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** I suspect slow computers can encounter long running times since we are simulating a lot of sample paths. It took us a couple of minutes to run the full program on a fairly decent computer. Apart from that, only the standard Anaconda Python 3 installation is required.
